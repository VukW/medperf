# Overview

The tutorials simulate a benchmarking example for the task of detecting thoracic diseases from chest X-ray scans. You can find the description of the used data [here](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community). Throughout the tutorials, you will be interacting with a temporary local MedPerf server as described in the [setup page](setup.md). This allows you to freely experiment with the MedPerf client and rerun the tutorials as many times as you want, providing you with an immersive learning experience. Please note that these tutorials also serve as a general guidance to be followed when using the MedPerf client in a real scenario.

Before proceeding to the tutorials, make sure you have the general tutorial environment [set up](setup.md).

To ensure users have the best experience in learning the fundamentals of MedPerf and utilizing the MedPerf client, the following set of tutorials are provided:
